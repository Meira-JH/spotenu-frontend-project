Spotenu is my first solo FullStack project. It consists in the development of an imaginary web-desktop-first application, as an activity result of Labenu's full-stack development course. The front-end code uses ReactJS as main framework and Firebase hosting/deploy. The back-end is structured through Google's Cloud Firestore platform.

## Code architecture :computer:

This code was designed concerned with JS best practices to best fit the use of react-redux connected-router tools/libs. In order to do that, the source folder was divided in actions, components, containers, pages, reducers, router and support folders (Hooks, imgs and util).

:small_blue_diamond: **actions**: folder containing all the files with functions for communicating the application with the Redux Store;

:small_blue_diamond: **components**: folder containing React components that will be part of a page;

:small_blue_diamond: **pages**: folder containing React components rendered through paths configured in the connected-router;

:small_blue_diamond: **reducers**: folder containing configuration, logic and structure of files that compose Redux Store.

:small_blue_diamond: **router**: folder with files that integrate the application through routes.
