Spotenu is my first FullStack project. It consists in the development of an imaginary web-desktop-first application, as an activity result of Labenu's full-stack development course. The front-end code uses ReactJS as main framework and Firebase hosting/deploy. The back-end is structured through Google's Cloud Firestore platform.
